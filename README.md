# Attendance_System
Firstly I created a folder and store the images of students along with their names.

Then through OpenCV , video frames were captured and using dlib library face detection part is basically done using embeddings. 

I did the recognition part with the help of face encodings using face recognition library.

At last based on recognised name, the attendance were marked in csv file
